I’m currently a **Postdoc Researcher in Artificial Intelligence** at the Computer Science Department of Sapienza University of Rome.
My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Digital Signal Processing, Continual Learning, and Human-Computer Interaction.

I hold a PhD from the *Italian National PhD in Artificial Intelligence* program, where I deepened my expertise in AI and Deep Learning. My doctoral research, titled [*"Sparking Light on Deep Learning in EEG Research"*](https://iris.uniroma1.it/retrieve/535c6ba9-66b7-4799-808e-05254230efde/Tesi_dottorato_Lanzino.pdf), critically examined the recent success of neural networks in physiological signal analysis, highlighting and challenging some of the more surprising claims in the field.

Before pursuing my PhD, I earned both my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at Sapienza, graduating with honors. My master’s thesis, *"Laplacian-regularized Transductive Inference for Few-shot Object Detection"*, was supervised by Prof. Fabio Galasso.

Beyond research, I actively contribute to the academic community. I serve as a reviewer for top-tier conferences and journals such as **ICCV**, **NeurIPS**, **IEEE Transactions on Multimedia**, and **Nature Scientific Reports**, and co-organize workshops at major venues, including **BISCUIT** and **VisionDocs** at ICCV'25.
